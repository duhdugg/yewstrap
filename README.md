# Yewstrap

Yewstrap is a collection of reusable, Bootstrap-compatible Yew/Rust components for
WebAssembly user interfaces.

I am aiming to replicate most of the functionality of [Preaction Bootstrap
Clips](https://github.com/duhdugg/preaction-bootstrap-clips) and [Preaction
Inputs](https://github.com/duhdugg/preaction-inputs), which I wrote for the Bootstrap
and React/javascript ecosystem. I like to provide a set of standard template components
that can be used across multiple applications. Ask yourself this: How many times do you
want to build the core functionality of a navigation bar? For me, the answer is "no more than necessary". The interesting parts of your applications' functionality should be
separate from its core UI components. Those UI components should be tested and stable,
and you should be able to use them semantically. That is what this project aims to
accomplish.

Follow this repo for updates! I am quite excited about this project, and you should see
more here soon!
